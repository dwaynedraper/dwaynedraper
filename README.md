# Dean Draper - React/Next.js frontend developer.
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Dean Dwayne Draper. I'm a React/Next.js developer with a love for TypeScipt and TailwindCSS. I have had a passion for art and design since I was handed a crayon in kindergarten, and although my medium has occasionally changed, my love for creation will always persist. I bring years of experience with art, graphic design, UI/UX, and photography to the table as well as my coding skills, which I believe gives me a competitive edge over many frontend devs. I can translate designs into beautiful UIs quickly and efficiently. I understand color psychology and theory, accessibility, and how to achieve strong brand recognition through unique and consistent design language.
### I am currently on the lookout for a frontend development role. I would love to work with React and Next, as they are my specialty, but I would not be opposed to picking up Svelte or Vue either. I have limited experience with backend technologies, including Node, Express, Nest, and JOI, and know my way around MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis as well. I am AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and I am working on my Developer Associate.
