## üëã Hi there 
My name is Dean Dwayne Draper. I'm a React/Next.js developer with a love for TypeScript and TailwindCSS. I have had a passion for art and design since I was handed a crayon in kindergarten, and although my medium has occasionally changed, my love for creation will always persist. I bring years of experience with art, graphic design, UI/UX, and photography to the table as well as my coding skills, which I believe gives me a competitive edge over many other developers. I can translate designs into beautiful UIs quickly and efficiently. I understand color psychology and theory, accessibility, and how to achieve strong brand recognition through unique and consistent design language.

I am currently on the lookout for a frontend-heavy development role. I would love to work with React and Next, as they are my specialty, but I would not be opposed to picking up Svelte or Vue either. I have extensive experience with backend technologies as well, including Node, Express, MongoDB, and AWS.

## üì∞ Certifications
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (Dev Assoc. in progress)
* MongoDB Developer Associate
* Meta Front-End Developer
