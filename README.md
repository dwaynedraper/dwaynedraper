# Dean Draper - React/Next.js frontend developer.
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is Dean Dwayne Draper. I'm a React/Next.js developer with a love for TypeScript and TailwindCSS. I have had a passion for art and design since I was handed a crayon in kindergarten, and although my medium has occasionally changed, my love for creation will always persist. I bring years of experience with art, graphic design, UI/UX, and photography to the table as well as my coding skills, which I believe gives me a competitive edge over many other developers. I can translate designs into beautiful UIs quickly and efficiently. I understand color psychology and theory, accessibility, and how to achieve strong brand recognition through unique and consistent design language.
### I am currently on the lookout for a frontend-heavy development role. I would love to work with React and Next, as they are my specialty, but I would not be opposed to picking up Svelte or Vue either. I have extensive experience with backend technologies as well, including Node, Express, MongoDB, and AWS. I am actually an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and will have my Developer Associate within the next 6 months.

## My Stack
* React/Next.js
* Redux
* TypeScript
* Node/Express
* MongoDB
* TailwindCSS
* AWS
* Vercel
* Docker

## Certifications
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* Meta Front-End Developer
* MongoDB Developer Associate (I will end of September anyway)
